G80iLTctFuY,Shawn Ryan Show,2024-08-26 21:30:03,President Donald J. Trump - Make America Great Again | SRS #127,"Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States and is now running for a second term. In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election as a Republican. Unlike the politicians before him, President Trump had a unique style and message that energized the American public. His appeal to many Americans stemmed from his status as a political outsider and his portrayal as a break from traditional career politicians.

During and after his presidency, Trump faced significant opposition and controversy from the establishment, including two impeachments by the House of Representatives‚Äîfirst in 2019 over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in 2021 over incitement of insurrection related to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. He was acquitted by the Senate in both cases. Most recently, there was an attempt on his life when a gunman opened fire during a rally in Pennsylvania, wounding the President and two spectators, and killing one supporter.

Today, President Trump is running on a platform dedicated to strong border and immigration policies, lowering taxes and inflation, achieving energy independence, and ending the weaponization of the media and government agencies. In this episode of SRS, Shawn met with the President in Las Vegas to discuss his vision for the future and how he intends to ""make America great again.""

Shawn was getting an inside scoop in Tony's EDC when he shares this INTENSE combat story.

This has to be one of the most intense close-quarters, hand-to-hand gunfights in a war zone. After being held at gunpoint, Tony Cowden meets the enemy with resistance using his own firearm, and they begin to engage in a ground gunfight. When his pistol went out of battery, he fixed the malfunction on the enemy's back and finished them off.

Bustamante tells us how a 5,000 year old country like China moves slowly and quietly with little known initiatives like the ""Belt Way,"" and how he believes a move to take Taiwan is an imminent threat. 
We dive deep into the recent Spy Balloon phenomenon over US airspace and growing Chinese influence and capability across the globe through social media and shadow propaganda. We wrap up with a realistic look at the severity of different types of threats like EMPs and China's financial stakes on land and resources here at home.

3PfsANvaueQ,Shawn Ryan Show,2023-03-06 23:30:03,Chris / Kristin Beck - Transgender Navy SEAL Transitions To Woman Then Back To Man | SRS #50,"Episode #50 is one of the most important interviews you'll ever hear. Chris Beck is a retired Navy Seal with 20 years service & 15 deployments under his belt. Even with his Bronze Star with Valor, Chris wasn't only known for his skills behind the trigger, but for his brilliance in technology and engineering.

Chris pioneered the mission planning systems for all of SOCOM, revolutionized the future of warfare with the ""Iron Man"" Project, and contracted for the Pentagon with a $600 million dollar research and development budget. Despite all of his accomplishments, Chris was facing demons in private. TBIs, PTSD, and a traumatic childhood sent Chris down a path to find out who he truly was. Through trauma and misguided agendas, Chris transitioned to a woman and after years of being pulled into this ideology, ultimately started the long journey to transitioning back into the man he always was.

This episode explores his journey through an abusive childhood, the trans agenda, and the nuance of sexuality & biology. Chris's fiance' Courtney joins us and explains how gender dysphoria can endanger and influence children and how society has reached a breakpoint with these issues. Stick around until the end of the episode to learn how Chris sparing a life in combat may have set the stage for him to save his own and how thousands of others will be.

JD Vance, known for his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, is Donald Trump's VP pick and has built a reputation for his deep understanding of Middle America and its struggles. On this solemn day, 9/11, JD shares not only where he was on that fateful day but also the tragic stories from this sober anniversary, reflecting on how the events shaped the course of his life and his decision to enlist in the Marine Corps. He highlights the wave of enlistments that followed 9/11 and contrasts it with today's troubling decline in recruitment.

In this episode, we dive deep into Vance‚Äôs views on pressing issues like the Biden-Harris administration‚Äôs funding of terrorism and the ongoing war in Ukraine. We explore the troubling amount of taxpayer dollars being spent overseas while American families face financial struggles at home. JD also shares his insight on Israel, the crisis at the border, government reform, and the evolving role of AI technology. This conversation not only covers current policy challenges but also explores JD Vance's vision for addressing these critical issues facing our nation.

Operation Gothic Serpent would claim the lives of 18 U.S. service members‚Äìthe deadliest battle since Vietnam. Tom Satterly was on the ground that day. This is his story.

m3A1meW02Tk,Shawn Ryan Show,2024-01-29 23:30:09,Dom Raso - SEAL Team 6 / DEVGRU Operator | SRS #94,"Dom Raso is a former SEAL Team Six / DEVGRU Operator whose career spans across twelve years and multiple combat deployments during the Global War on Terror. Raso served in Gold Squadron, an outfit that suffered a staggering loss during an attack on August 6, 2011 when a Chinook CH-47 (call sign: Extortion 17) was shot down by insurgents. This was the most devastating day in SEAL Team Six history, as well as the single largest loss of life for U.S. forces since the war in Afghanistan began in 2001.

Raso is well known for his contributions to DEVGRU in the way of research and development and combative techniques. Post his military career, he took those same lessons learned to create his brand Crush Everything / Dynamis Alliance. As CEO, Raso seeks to prepare the next generation by embracing sacrifice and using it as a positive energy to ""crush everything"" that he does.

Roosevelt

These were the words that would change the course of history forever. These words would also give way to the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the most costly campaigns of World War II. Of the 7,000 killed and nearly 20,000 wounded, Don Graves, a Marine would survive amongst them. Graves shouldered one of the most feared responsibilities in the Marine Corps‚Äìwielding a flamethrower in the caves and pill boxes that littered the island. In this episode, Graves recounts his experience in those 36 days of fighting and lends his perspective on where the country is headed now. Graves, now 98 years of age, has a wise view and a wealth of knowledge to share with the American people.

Q9i_es05rWc,Shawn Ryan Show,2023-09-11 21:30:08,"Mark ""Oz"" Geist - 13 Hours Survivor Reflects on the Deadly Benghazi Attacks | SRS #74","Today marks the 11th anniversary of the unprecedented attack on a U.S. Consulate and CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya that claimed the lives of four Americans‚Äì J. Christopher Stevens (U.S. Ambassador), Sean Smith (U.S. Foreign Service Information Officer), Glen ""Bub"" Doherty (U.S. Navy SEAL / CIA), and Tyrone S. ""Rone"" Woods (U.S Navy Seal / CIA).

The aftermath of this attack resulted in ten investigations spanning two years that shook the core of American foreign policy and protocol within the State Department. The survivors would also consult on the critically acclaimed film ""13 Hours"" that depicted the attack, based on the book co-authored by the survivors.

SRS is honored to have Mark Geist, one of the surviving members of the Annex Security team, on to share his story. Mark Geist is a former Marine, Sheriff, and CIA Security Consultant / Contractor that fought off the attack and is credited with saving over twenty-five lives.

Ahmad Massoud - The Assassination that Changed the World | SRS #121,"Ahmad Massoud is the Commander of the National Resistance Front (NRF) of Afghanistan. Massoud is the son of the late anti-soviet and revolutionary commander, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and hails from the Province of Takhar in Northeast Afghanistan. After the assassination of his father in 2001, Ahmad and his family settled in the UK, where he completed his higher education and military training at the Sandhurst Military Academy. Ahmad received his bachelor‚Äôs degree in War Studies from Kings College London and his master‚Äôs degree in International Politics from City, University of London. 

After completing his education, Ahmad returned to Afghanistan and started his political movement. Supporters of his father declared him as the successor of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud. Now, he continues to advocate for the freedom of his people, appearing in the media and garnering support from allied nations. His vision for the country is reminiscent of his father's‚Äìdecentralized, multicultural, and modern. Massoud recently authored In the Name of my Father: Struggling for Freedom in Afghanistan. This memoir explores his aspirations for his nation‚Äôs future and his commitment to the values of liberty, justice, and human rights.

Park recounts her oppressive childhood in North Korea, starved and without electricity. She remembers how the lights of neighboring countries gave her hope for a better life. She spares no detail when explaining what a society under a ruthless dictator, mass killings, and delusional propaganda looks like.

Yeonmi takes us through her harrowing journey being smuggled out of North Korea only to meet a new terrifying reality - the Chinese sex trafficking trade. Park speaks frankly about the realities of survival in captivity and the pain she carries with her still today. We wrap up with her rescue by missionaries and her first brush with freedom in Times Square. Yeonmi illuminates some hard truths and warns of the signs of communism seeping into the United States.

Tony is a former Green Beret and CIA contractor with an impeccable career having served in multiple combat deployments. In part one of this two-part series, we cover Tony's upbringing and how his father helped fuel his capacity for resourcefulness and an unmatched work ethic.

Tony recounts his experience in the ""Red Cell"" Program where he was tracking and surveilling assets on American soil and how he barely made it out of a sticky situation alive on the day of the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Don't miss the harrowing story of how Tony single-handedly held off wave after wave of attackers when he was cut off, alone and outnumbered in the streets of Iraq. 26 bodies of enemy combatants were recovered from this firefight.

Geary boasts an incredible twenty four year career in NSW. Captain Geary has completed numerous deployments throughout the world while serving in leadership positions at SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two, SEAL Team Four, and Naval Special Warfare Tactical Development and Evaluation Squadron Three.

Geary's career now hangs in the balance due to a Navy probe into the mysterious death of trainee and Seaman Kyle Mullen, who tragically lost his life during the infamous training period known as ""Hell Week."" The Navy investigation initially pinned blame on the training cadre, but as pressure from Congress and Geary's testimony grows, a different narrative is coming to light. Geary's attorney stated that ""when all the key facts emerge, the Navy's improper actions will be exposed -- and it will be undeniable that Capt. Geary is being scapegoated as part of a larger scheme to cover up massive failures and abuses of power at the highest levels of the Navy.""

However, a meeting with an Area 51 specialist on the property led to a series of unexplained and peculiar phenomena. This encounter profoundly impacted him and fueled his determination to pursue the truths concealed within the ranch.

During this episode, we learn about Brandon's upbringing, explore how he built a prosperous career in commercial real estate, and delve into his acquisition of the infamous Skinwalker Ranch from Aerospace billionaire, Robert Bigelow.

Brandon has allocated millions of dollars to support research endeavors at the ranch, unraveling anomalies along the way. True to his character, he has never personally profited from these exploits, opting instead to reinvest proceeds into the project and charitable causes.

You'll get to hear about operations that were declassified in just the last few weeks. Do not miss this one.

The Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) is a highly secretive and elite special operations unit of the Canadian Armed Forces, specializing in counter-terrorism operations, both at home and abroad. Dallas Alexander and his JTF2 Sniper Team were responsible for landing the world's farthest shot, breaking every record before it.

qjz_07-DvE0,Shawn Ryan Show,2023-05-08 21:30:09,Ryan Montgomery - #1 Ethical Hacker Who Hunts Child Predators Catches One Live On Podcast | SRS #56,"1 in 5 children in the United States will be sexually exploited online. Every 9 minutes, Child Protective Services finds evidence of child sexual abuse. 93% of victims know the perpetrator. These are horrifying and sobering statistics that drove the Shawn Ryan Show to expose this topic‚Äìthis is where Ryan Montgomery comes in.

Ryan is the #1 ""ethical hacker"" in the world and it's a title he's earned by infiltrating websites that host child exploitation and exposing the predators that run rampant there. Ryan takes us into the underbelly of this dark-web hidden world and lights it up in real time. During the filming of this show, Ryan ran a mini-sting operation from his laptop in a chatroom, posing as a teen‚Äìit took less than 60 seconds for a predator to take the bait.

This episode is a cold, hard look at the pervasive problem that is child exploitation. Although it's difficult to stomach, we do believe that this episode will educate parents and save thousands of children. Ryan has dedicated his life to saving human life via his treatment center for those with addiction and by forcing this vile topic into the light. We are honored to share his message.

ZZ-JXDoqsnc,Shawn Ryan Show,2023-07-31 21:30:10,Tyler Vargas-Andrews - Marine's Horrific Account of the Disastrous Afghanistan EVAC | SRS #68,"The United States withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan in August of 2021, signaling the end of a nearly 20 year conflict that cost 8 Trillion dollars and the lives of 900,000 people, including over 7,000 U.S. Service Members. The U.S. exit from Afghanistan resulted in the Taliban reestablishing armed control of the country and created a refugee crisis as over 1.5 Million Afghans fled. The withdrawal has been widely considered a disaster and a gross display of incompetent leadership from the President down, echoing similar failures seen at Saigon nearly half a century earlier.

SRS is honored to present the story and view point from one of the Marines on the ground in Kabul, just days before the last U.S. Embassy fell‚ÄìTyler Vargas-Andrews. On August 26th, Vargas-Andrews was gravely wounded by a suicide bombing at the gates of Kabul's Airport, ultimately losing two limbs as a result of his injuries. This premeditated attack killed 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. Service Members.

This episode dives deep into his role in the invasion of Iraq and the capture of Saddam Hussein. VanSant vividly recalls an engagement with over 300 enemy combatants after a goat herder revealed his team's location. We get a first hand account of the operational tempo it takes to hunt down each player of the infamous ""Deck of Cards,"" and what happens when a handful of Delta Operators are outnumbered in the Horn of Africa with only the Navy Destroyer U.S.S. Chafee for cover.

VanSant tells stories of loss and grappling with the survivor's guilt that would ultimately change the course of his life. Chris serves on the board of the All Secure Foundation and is on a multi-year effort to complete the seven summits to raise awareness for veteran mental health and support All Secure.

XRTon6qgVws,Shawn Ryan Show,2024-02-05 23:30:07,Joe McMoneagle - CIA's Project Stargate | SRS #95,"Joe McMoneagle is a former U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer and was among the first Remote Viewers to be recruited into the previously classified Stargate Project. Project Stargate was the United States' first organized research into psychic phenomena via the Defense Intelligence Agency and contractor SRI International.

In this episode, McMoneagle takes us back to the early days of the Vietnam War and how he was recruited into intelligence operations. The height of the Cold War fueled appetites for advantages over the United States' enemies and gave way to the CIA's push into ""psychic and extra sensory perception"" research and military applications.

Post his military retirement, McMoneagle authored several books to critical acclaim like ""The Stargate Chronicles: Memoirs of a Psychic Spy"" and continued his work via his private venture‚ÄìIntuitive Intelligence Applications, Inc. He now teaches Remote Viewing at The Monroe Institute, a world leader in human consciousness exploration.

Thank you for listening ‚ù§ Check out our sponsors: https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep453-sb
See below for timestamps, transcript, and to give feedback, submit questions, contact Lex, etc.

*Update: 3rd Audio Track with Original Audio:* 
I've added a 3rd audio track with the original audio, with Lex speaking English and Javier Milei speaking Spanish. To listen to it, please choose ""English (United Kingdom)"" audio track, by clicking on: Settings (Gear Icon), Audio Track, Choose: English (United Kingdom). So, ""English (US)"" is the fully english dubbed track, and ""English (UK)"" is the original bilingual track. For the latter, you can turn on subtitles as well. For now, this is the best I can do. I will work with the YouTube team to figure out a better solution. I tried really hard to make this conversation as accessible as possible to people who speak only English or Spanish. I'll keep trying to figure out how to do this better. Your feedback is deeply appreciated. Thank you for listening. I love you all! ‚ù§

*Corrections/Clarifications in Translation:* 
- The English translation at 23:23 says ""fiscal deficit"" when it should say ""fiscal balance"". We fixed the captions, transcript, and will try to fix the audio soon üôè
- A few times ""liberal"" is mentioned. In most of the world (except US) that means ""classical liberal"" which in US is better understood as ""libertarian"". 

*Switch between English & Spanish Versions:*
This podcast is translated and dubbed into Spanish. To switch between English & Spanish, click: Settings (Gear Icon) , Audio Track , Choose Language.

Thank you to ElevenLabs for their amazing help with translation & dubbing üôè'
